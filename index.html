        <p>
          I specialise in going beyond the "full-stack" &mdash; crafting tech products and user experiences from conceptualisation, product research, UI design, to building reactive frontend clients, architecting backend APIs, to deployment, monitoring, and third-party integrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having worked with Javascript frameworks from Ember.js to Vue for over 12 years, I bring with me a deep understanding of frontend subtleties, and best practices. At the same time, I like having a hand in a broad base of disciplines, be it backend APIs and services with Rails, Node, or serverless architectures, as well as UI design and UX. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Business / Economics graduate, I also have an interest in data and statistics, and cannot help but consider real-world business needs and human psychology even while solving technical problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          
          I&apos;ve found that being able to simultaneously play the role of product manager, designer, and engineer leads me to create robust products with great speed, and allows me to communicate with investors, management, or designers and engineers in my team with empathy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I take pride in creating enjoyable user experiences and derive satisfaction from seeing users easily pick up an app, become more awesome, and then tell us how much it changed their lives.

        <h4>Crafting a Native Mobile Experience</h4>
        <h5>Design, JS, Cordova</h5>
        <p>
          As CTO, I designed, built, and laid the groundwork for an interaction-rich Javascript mobile app with near-native animations, gestures, and performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with any new project and startup, thousands of design and architectural decisions had to be made with regard to audience, UX, design language, frameworks, plugins, services, code structure and organisation, etc.

        <h4>API and Admin Web App Designed for Efficiency</h4>
        <h5>Ember, Rails, node.js, devops</h5>
        <p>
          The customer-facing mobile app is paired with a fully-featured admin web app that is optimised for efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together with an API, I had to lay out a complex system of backend jobs, integrations with 3rd parties and various microservices with node.js, Puppeteer, AWS Lambda and Firebase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although historically not my forte, I also had to dive into devops, set up services, optimise for performance, fix memory leaks, etc.

        <h5>Statistics, Domain knowledge</h5>
        <p>
          Healthcare is probably the most complex vertical I&apos;ve been exposed to, being deeply personal yet also having a huge breadth of issues and stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the course of the work I got to pick up knowledge from an entirely new domain, and also had the chance to apply statistics and econometrics knowledge to nibble away at data science topics, build financial models, and even contribute in a small way to <a href="https://spj.sciencemag.org/journals/hds/2022/9892340/" target="_blank">a research paper publication</a>.

        <h5>Management, Communication, Mentorship</h5>
        <p>
          Management is always the biggest challenge and an area where I am continually learning the most. Figuring out a product direction and roadmap is difficult enough, and project management complex enough, but hiring, mentoring, and managing a team is one of the hardest (but most rewarding) parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this role, I am very grateful for the opportunity to have managed and mentored engineers, product designers, and data analysts, of varying seniorities.

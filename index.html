            I&rsquo;m primarily an Ember.js developer, but I code the full stack,
            enjoy designing beautiful user experiences, and occasionally
            travel the world doing handstands.

        <p>
          I am a generalist, specialising in building web apps with Ember.js, especially for SaaS industries. I&rsquo;ve worked with Ember.js since pre-1.0, and have made contributions to Ember Data and other addons. Over the past 6 years, I&rsquo;ve gained a good understanding of the framework&rsquo;s subtleties, vision, as well as shortcomings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also work on UI design occasionally, and have a good intuition for UX. This blend of skills means I&rsquo;m comfortable crafting an entire user experience on my own &mdash; from conceptualising, researching and designing, structuring an API, to building the frontend app, deploying, and integrating with third party services.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy creating enjoyable user experiences and derive satisfaction from seeing users easily pick up an app, become more awesome, and then tell us how much it changed their lives.

          Based loosely on the now defunct <a href="https://github.com/ef4/rfcs/blob/routeable-components/active/0000-routeable-components.md" target="_blank">Routable Components RFC</a>, I implemented routable components for today&rsquo;s Ember as an addon.

        <h5>Ember, SVG, Performance</h5>
        <p>
          Early on, I helped migrate a legacy app to ES6, Ember CLI, and ember-cli-deploy, and appreciated the chance to implement new processes, coding styles, and best practices from my experience with Ember.
        </p>
        <p>
          One interesting feature I created was a seat selection tool, which had to be performant on both desktop and mobile and handle a variety of scenarios and business needs.

        <p>
          I then took on the conceptualisation, redesign and development of a small legacy mobile app into a performant Ember mobile web app &mdash; complete with &ldquo;Offline Mode&rdquo; using AppCache, WebSockets sync, and barcode scanning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I appreciated the freedom to design and build, as well as the challenge of creating a native-like experience for the mobile web.

        <h4>Leading a Large Scale Revamp</h4>
        <h5>Ember, Product Management</h5>
        <p>
          Finally, I collaborated on a complete revamp of a huge SaaS app &mdash; a rare chance to put all my experience into structuring a brand new Ember app with best practices &mdash; in a way that scales easily, avoids complexity, is future-proof, yet doesn&rsquo;t compromise on user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also played a product manager / lead role &mdash; digging up user stories and needs from the customer-facing team, pushing UX further with the designer, debating the API approach, all in addition to leading the frontend development.

          I helped design and build TradeGecko&rsquo;s flagship product &mdash; and as the first employee, had a direct influence in the startup&rsquo;s vision and growth. As part of a small team, customer support was also an integral part of the work.
